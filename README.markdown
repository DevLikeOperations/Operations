# GrantOps
DevOps, as applied to grant writing.

# Purpose
Development Operations, or DevOps as we like to call it, refers to the processes by which a bunch
of unstable code monkies are herded in a productive fashion. It's an answer to the chaos that
arisis from the process of multiple people (or just one very disorganized person such as myself)
attempting to work on the same complex set of documents, at the same time. Clearly, the solution
is in automation, and the idea of Continuous Integration. This particular Ops repository is
concerned primarily with GrantOps (Grantwriting Ops), but of course easily adapted to any similar
situation. If you adapt this to another workflow, we ask that you contribute it back, as described
in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.markdown).
